# Project-Lawnmover

## Description
In this project, there are two algorithms, lawnmower and alternate. These algorithms would sort an unsorted list of disks (light and dark) by having the light disks first and then the dark disks.

Input: a positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of alternating colors (light, dark), starting with light
output: A list of 2n disks. The first n disks are light, and the following n disks are dark, and an integer represents the number of swaps to move the dark ones after the light ones.
